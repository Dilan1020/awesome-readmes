<h5 align="center">Another curated list of awesome readmes for inspiration and learning.</h5>

---

- **[Choojs](https://github.com/choojs/choo):** Choojs is a small framework for building front-end applications. The readme is fun in tone and descriptive. The readme also accepts information that can be placed elsewhere and does it.

- **[Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app):** Create-React-App (or CRA) is the de-facto boilerplate for getting a zero-configuration ReactJS environment together. The README not only shows animated GIF images of how to get started, but it also provides deep and rich step-by-step documentation of adding other popular tools to the front end ecosystem like Sass, code-splitting, routers, static typechecking, and many more.

- **[Developer CI Benefits](https://github.com/yowainwright/developer-ci-benefits):** Developer CI Benefits is a repository dedicated to making clear how accessible CI benefits are to developers. The readme describes the intent of the repository as well as links to documents providing more detail about developer CI benefits in digestable documents.

- **[HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD):** HEAD provides a list of everything that *could* go in the head of your document. The entire repo is a single file: `README.md`. The readme has a ton of code snippets that can be directly copied-and-pasted into your project, it has a table of contents, has been translated into 7 languages, and even has spiffy "Back to Top" links at the end of each section (super useful because the readme is long).

- **[jquery.pep.js](https://github.com/briangonzalez/jquery.pep.js):** JQuery Pep is a [jQuery plugin](https://plugins.jquery.com/) that makes items draggable on a webpage or app. The readme provides an eloquent table of listing out API properties that can be used to achieve the desired drag result.

- **[Otto](https://github.com/KartikChugh/Otto):** Otto is an intelligent chat application that makes machine learning an intuitive, natural language experience. The readme contains a high-level overview of the project, tons of fun, animated GIF demos of its features, Quick Start examples and a detailed, step-by-step breakdown.

- **[stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits):** Stickybits is a lightweight alternative to `position: sticky` polyfills. The readme fully outlines the API of the library, provides examples, outlines contributing guidelines, and even says thanks at the end.

- **[Terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer)** Terminalizer generates animated gif images by recording all your actions on a CLI interface. The tool itself is extremely useful for demonstrating installation instructions, CLI tool usage, etc. Terminalizer not only shows an excellent example of how it renders an image, but includes no-nonsense installation instructions, a step by step "getting started" section, and customization options in a skimmable and gif + example oriented fashion, in addition to how to handle common errors and issues.

- **[TriumphMayflowerClub.com](https://github.com/Stack-in-a-box/triumphmayflowerclub.com)** A simple classic car club website, but it is presented as a very open project for lesser-experienced developers to be able to cut their teeth on, with a friendly, inclusive tone and accessible set-up instructions. Includes many common elements found in other beautiful READMEs, such as a tidy and centered header section, featuring the club logo, section links and Shields.io badges, screenshot as a hero image, project background, overview of technologies used, table of contents, tasteful and sparing use of emoji, feature list and future roadmap, project maintainer contact details and plenty of relevant inline links.

- **[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack):** Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript. The readme describes what Webpack is and then offers a high level of how to install it what it can do. Webpack then goes into the tools it works with and the people that build the project which creates a great sense of community. It has documentation beyond the readme that goes above and beyond to be thoughtful for its community.

- **[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman):** Yeoman is a generator for front end applications. If that was unknown by the well documented pages, the [artwork](https://github.com/yeoman/media) provides clear and engaging context.
