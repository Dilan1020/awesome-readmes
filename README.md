<h5 align="center">Another curated list of awesome readmes for inspiration and learning.</h5>

---

-  **[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman):** Yeoman is a generator for front end applications. If that was unknown by the well documented pages, the [artwork](https://github.com/yeoman/media) provides clear and engaging context. 

-  **[Choojs](https://github.com/choojs/choo):** Choojs is a small framework for building front-end applications. The readme is fun in tone and descriptive. The readme also accepts information that can be placed elsewhere and does it.   

-  **[jquery.pep.js](https://github.com/briangonzalez/jquery.pep.js):** JQuery Pep is a [jQuery plugin](https://plugins.jquery.com/) that makes items draggable on a webpage or app. The readme provides an eloquent table of listing out API properties that can be used to achieve the desired drag result.

-  **[HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD):** HEAD provides a list of everything that *could* go in the head of your document. The entire repo is a single file: `README.md`. The readme has a ton of code snippets that can be directly copied-and-pasted into your project, it has a table of contents, has been translated into 7 languages, and even has spiffy "Back to Top" links at the end of each section (super useful because the readme is quite long).
