<h5 align="center">Another curated list of awesome readmes for inspiration and learning.</h5>

---

- **[Choojs](https://github.com/choojs/choo):** Choojs is a small framework for building front-end applications. The readme is fun in tone and descriptive. The readme also accepts information that can be placed elsewhere and does it.

- **[Developer CI Benefits](https://github.com/yowainwright/developer-ci-benefits):** Developer CI Benefits is a repository dedicated to making clear how accessible CI benefits are to developers. The readme describes the intent of the repository as well as links to documents providing more detail about developer CI benefits in digestable documents.

- **[HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD):** HEAD provides a list of everything that *could* go in the head of your document. The entire repo is a single file: `README.md`. The readme has a ton of code snippets that can be directly copied-and-pasted into your project, it has a table of contents, has been translated into 7 languages, and even has spiffy "Back to Top" links at the end of each section (super useful because the readme is long).

- **[jquery.pep.js](https://github.com/briangonzalez/jquery.pep.js):** JQuery Pep is a [jQuery plugin](https://plugins.jquery.com/) that makes items draggable on a webpage or app. The readme provides an eloquent table of listing out API properties that can be used to achieve the desired drag result.

- **[stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits):** Stickybits is a lightweight alternative to `position: sticky` polyfills. The readme fully outlines the API of the library, provides examples, outlines contributing guidelines, and even says thanks at the end.

- **[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack):** Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript. The readme describes what Webpack is and then offers a high level of how to install it what it can do. Webpack then goes into the tools it works with and the people that build the project which creates a great sense of community. It has documentation beyond the readme that goes above and beyond to be thoughtful for its community.

- **[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman):** Yeoman is a generator for front end applications. If that was unknown by the well documented pages, the [artwork](https://github.com/yeoman/media) provides clear and engaging context.

- **[Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app):** Create-React-App (or CRA) is the de-facto boilerplate for getting a zero-configuration ReactJS environment together. The README not only shows animated GIF images of how to get started, but it also provides deep and rich step-by-step documentation of adding other popular tools to the front end ecosystem like Sass, code-splitting, routers, static typechecking, and many more.
